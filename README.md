# FPGAcrypto
FPGAcrypto is a collection of scripts for testing secure computation of cryptographic algorithms on FPGA accelerators by generating Verilog code which is converted to C++, compiled to source, and then benchmarked. This repository was created as part of a term project for CPRE 5810, Computer Hardware Architecture, at Iowa State University.
